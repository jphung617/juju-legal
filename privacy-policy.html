            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Juju Baby Tracker</strong> (“the App”) is developed and
              operated by <strong>Jason Phung</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
              This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and
              protect personal data when you use the App, a collaborative baby
              tracking app for solo or multiple caregivers to log baby
              activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy
              Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.

            <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Photo Library Access</strong> – used only when you
                choose to upload baby or family photos.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push Notifications</strong> (planned) – used for

            <p>The App does not access or collect location data.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create and manage your account and family space</li>
              <li>Sync baby activity data between invited caregivers</li>
              <li>Display historical logs of your baby’s care</li>

              <li>Support advertising and the optional “Remove Ads” purchase</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do not sell your personal information. We do not share baby

              this policy.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Advertising &amp; Monetization</h2>

            <h3>5.1 AdMob</h3>
            <p>
              The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob
              may collect certain device identifiers or usage information
              necessary to deliver personalized or non-personalized ads,
              depending on your device and platform settings.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 One-Time Purchase to Remove Ads</h3>
            <p>
              You may choose to remove ads via a one-time in-app purchase.
              After purchasing, the App will no longer show AdMob ads for your
              account.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
            <p>
              We use Google Firebase services, including Firebase
              Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Storage.
            </p>
            <p>Firebase provides the following protections:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> Data is transmitted over
                secure connections using TLS.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> Data stored in Firestore
                and Firebase Storage is encrypted at rest.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Password protection:</strong> Passwords are securely
                handled by Firebase Authentication. We never store or access raw
                passwords.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While we take reasonable steps to protect your data, no system can
              be guaranteed 100% secure.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell your personal data. Your information may be
              processed by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Firebase services (to operate the App)</li>
              <li>Google AdMob (to deliver ads, when enabled)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other third-party data sharing is performed.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

            <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The App is intended for use by adults (parents and caregivers) and
              stores information <em>about</em> babies and children. Children do
              not create accounts or use the App directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We aim to collect only the information necessary to help
              caregivers track and coordinate baby care.
            </p>

            <h2>10. International Users</h2>
            <p>
              Your data may be processed and stored on servers operated by
              Google Firebase, which may be located in the United States or
              other regions consistent with Firebase’s infrastructure.
            </p>
