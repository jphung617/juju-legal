              This page explains how <strong>Juju Baby Tracker</strong> collects,
              uses, and protects your information. This is the same policy as
              your main privacy page, just rendered with a different visual
              style so you can test branding and layout.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Juju Baby Tracker (“the App”) is developed and operated by
              <strong>Jason Phung</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). The App is a
              collaborative baby tracking tool for solo or multiple caregivers
              to log baby activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not
              agree, please discontinue use of the App.
            </p>

              <li>Pump logs</li>
              <li>Timestamps for all activities</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
            <p>The App may request:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Photo Library Access</strong> – used only when you
                choose to upload baby or family photos.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push Notifications</strong> (planned) – for reminders or
                caregiver collaboration. You can manage notifications in your
                device settings.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The App does not collect or use location data.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create and manage your account and family space</li>
              <li>Sync baby activity data between invited caregivers</li>
              <li>Display historical logs and insights about your baby’s care</li>
              <li>Maintain and improve app reliability and performance</li>
              <li>Support advertising and the “Remove Ads” purchase option</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do not sell your personal information. We do not share baby
              data with third parties outside the services described below.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Backend Services &amp; Advertising</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Firebase Services</h3>
            <p>The App uses Google Firebase, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Firebase Authentication</li>
              <li>Cloud Firestore (database)</li>
              <li>Firebase Storage (for images)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Firebase encrypts data in transit using TLS and encrypts data at
              rest. Authentication credentials are handled securely by Firebase.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 AdMob &amp; Remove Ads Purchase</h3>
            <p>
              The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob
              may collect device identifiers or usage information needed to show
              ads, in accordance with your device and platform settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may choose to remove ads via a one-time in-app purchase. Once
              purchased, the App will no longer show AdMob ads for your
              account.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell your personal data. Your information may be
              processed by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Firebase services (to operate the App)</li>
              <li>Google AdMob (to serve ads, when enabled)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No other third-party data sharing is performed.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Retention &amp; Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
              We retain your data unless you request deletion. You may request:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deletion of your account and associated data</li>
              <li>Export of your logged data</li>
              <li>Updates to baby profile or account details</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To make a request, email
              <strong>jujubabytracker@gmail.com</strong> from the address
              associated with your account.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The App is intended for use by adults (parents and caregivers) and
              stores information <em>about</em> babies and children. Children do
              not create accounts or use the App directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We aim to collect only the information needed to help caregivers
              track and coordinate baby care.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Security</h2>
            <p>
              We rely on Firebase’s security features, including encryption at
              rest and in transit. While no system can be guaranteed 100% secure,
              we take reasonable steps to protect your information and encourage
              you to keep your account credentials safe.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes
              are made, the “Last updated” date may be revised. We encourage you
              to review the policy periodically.
            </p>
